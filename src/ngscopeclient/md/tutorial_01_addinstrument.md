# Add Instrument

Before you can do anything useful in ngscopeclient, you'll need to connect to an instrument (or generate a simulated waveform or load a saved session file, but that's a topic for later) so you have data to look at.

For this tutorial we'll be using ngscopeclient's built in oscilloscope simulator so don't worry if you don't have any real test equipment handy.

Select Connect from the Add | Oscilloscope menu.
