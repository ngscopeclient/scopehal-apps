# Horizontal Zoom

In conventional digital oscilloscopes, the display zoom setting and the sample rate / record length are locked so that changing one changes the other.

Since ngscopeclient allows you to have many views displaying the same waveform data, the horizontal zoom on a plot is independent of the timebase settings. The default record length for the demo scope is 1M samples which is much longer than the visible area of the plot.

Try using your mouse wheel (or touchpad vertical scroll axis) over the timeline or plot to zoom in and out. Zoom centers on the mouse position, so you can focus on different parts of the waveform.
